## ⚡ Quick Additions Needed (Optional):

### For Moon Phase & Aurora (Add These Files):

The code exists but needs the fixed moon.js file. Here's what to do:

**Refresh browser** → Open console (F12) → Look for errors

If you see moon/aurora errors, the API scripts are already there, just need initialization.
