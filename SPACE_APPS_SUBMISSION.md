## üéâ Demo Script (2 minutes)

**[Open SkyMirror]**

"Meet SkyMirror ‚Äî your window into space weather.

**[Scroll to Aurora Activity card]**
See this? Real NOAA space weather data. The sun is currently [calm/active]. If you're in Alaska tonight, you have a [X]% chance of seeing auroras.

**[Click aurora animation]**
This shows the solar wind hitting Earth's magnetosphere. When the Kp index goes above 5, auroras appear. Above 7? Major geomagnetic storm ‚Äî GPS can fail, power grids can overload.

**[Scroll to Current Scene]**
Every object here is clickable. **[Click Sun]** The Sun's story explains how solar flares and CMEs affect us.

**[Click Betelgeuse]**
This star is dying. When it explodes as a supernova, it'll be visible in daytime. We're watching a cosmic event millions of years in the making.

**[Scroll to Soundscape card]**
**[Click Play]** And this? Your weather as sound. Wind whooshing, atmospheric drone. Science through your ears.

**[Click Ritual banner]**
**[Chime plays]** Every day, reflect on the sky above you. SkyMirror saves it ‚Äî building a personal astronomy journal.

**[Close]**
That's SkyMirror: Space weather made beautiful, interactive, and meaningful. Thank you."
