# 🧪 Test Onboarding Flow

## To See the Onboarding (3 Options):

### Option 1: Clear All Data (Fresh Start)
Open DevTools (F12) → Console → Type:
```javascript
localStorage.clear()
location.reload()
```

### Option 2: Click Tutorial Button
Click the **📖 icon** in the top-right header

### Option 3: Click in Settings
Click ⚙️ Settings → Click "📖 Restart Welcome Tutorial"

## Expected Flow for First-Time Users:

1. **Welcome Screen** - Happy Sun introduces space weather
2. **8 Character Stories** - One by one with cute illustrations
3. **What About You?** - Feature preview
4. **Launch Animation** - "Look Up! SkyMirror looks back..."
5. **Main App Appears** - Weather dashboard loads

## How It Works:

- First visit: Onboarding shows automatically
- Returns: Goes straight to main app
- Tutorial stored in: `localStorage.getItem('skyMirrorOnboarding')`
- Value when complete: `'complete'`

## Current Status:

✅ Onboarding triggers on first load
✅ Can be skipped on any screen
✅ Can be restarted anytime
✅ Main app hidden until complete
✅ Stories fit screen with scrolling
